# Gradients

Please expect this folder to be a massive(ly) unorganized collection of all the gradients I've collected throughout the years. Generally speaking, these will be `.png` images that are intended to have an Acrylic (blur) overlayed on top or `.svg` images that (most of the time) have everything included and simply need to be displayed.
